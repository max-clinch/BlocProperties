#### Financial Transaction Management

##### Blockchain Technology
  Blockchain Technology has been adopted and adapted for use by the  commercial real estate (CRE) industry. Blockchain technology can  potentially transform core CRE operations such as property  transactions like purchase, sale, financing, leasing, and management transactions.

  Blockchain technology has impacted the real estate industry in a  variety of ways, including offering a new means for buyers and  sellers to connect with one another.

  Blockchain could be used to cut intermediaries out of the real estate transaction process, thereby reducing costs.

  This technology could also help to codify the practice of fractional ownership of real estate.

##### Digital Wallet - Metamask
    * Software that manages private keys and converts it to blockchain address format.
    * It’s a so-called digital wallet that runs as a Chrome extension. It stores Ethereum assets and shows transactions.

##### Ethereum Gas
---
Gas refers to the fee, or pricing value, required to successfully conduct a transaction or execute a contract on the Ethereum blockchain platform.
  * Every single operation that takes part in Ethereum, be it a simple transaction, or a smart contract, or even an ICO takes some amount of gas.
  *  Incentivizes nodes for participating in the network and computing 
  * Miners get paid an amount in Ether which is equivalent to the total amount of gas it took them to execute a complete operation. In that 
  *  Motivates developers to deploy efficient code to optimize the use of deployed proticols

##### Smart contracts
A smart contract is an agreement that needs no external action to execute the terms of the contract. Once the conditions for its execution have been met, the smart contract completes the agreed actions automatically.

Blockchain technology maintains a record of transactions is maintained across several computers linked in a peer-to-peer network. This allows smart contracts to be self-executing, with the terms of the agreement between buyer and seller directly written into lines of code existing on a decentralized network.

Ethereum allows developers to write smart contracts which define the EVM* instructions. (Ethereum Virtual Machine, Decentralized database – allows functional code to be distributed along the decentralized set of nodes.)

Smart contracts render transactions traceable, transparent, and 
irreversible.

Ethereum Real Estate Contracts are Flexible as contracts may be written so that any number of final sales prices, reductions in price, or increases, can be triggered based on specific events agreed to by the parties.


##### Digital Tokens - Non-Fungible Tokens(NFT)

1. **[ERC721 Standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721)**
      ERC-721 is a free, open standard that describes how to build non-fungible or unique tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. While most tokens are fungible (every token is the same as every other token), ERC-721 tokens are all unique.

      * ERC-721 defines a minimum interface a smart contract must implement to allow unique tokens to be managed, owned, and traded. It does not mandate a standard for token metadata or restrict adding supplemental functions.

      * Conduct Auctions on ERC721 standard and record payout formation on blockchain

### Instalation 
In a terminal, use NPM to install Truffle:
  * npm install -g truffle
You may receive a list of warnings during installation. To confirm that Truffle was installed correctly, run:
  * truffle version

###  Test Cases
